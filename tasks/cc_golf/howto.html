<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Thanks for playing our SpreadIT Code Golf!</strong> <br>
    The task is simple: write the program solving the task described below and try to make it as small as possible.
    <strong>Any byte counts!</strong> The system is counting spaces and new lines as wel ;)
    On the main page you can insert your code and it will be run and tested on backend. You will receive feedback (error or success info)
    and you can submit multiple times to improve your score (it will be overwritten based on your email). <br><br>

    There are 5 languages to choose from: Python 3.6, Ruby 2.4, bash 4.4, PHP 7.1 and Node.js 8.9 <br> <br>

    After successful attempt you will receive a random nickname, which we will call you by when announcing winners. You have to be present at the announcement
    at Clearcode stand at 14:45 today to get the prize (try to remember you nickname, but we can verify with email as well). If you won't be present, the next person
    in leaderboards will get the prize. <br><br>

    Huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/firemark/">firemark</a> of <a href="https://github.com/CodingDojoSilesia">Coding Dojo Silesia</a> for letting us use the code golf platform <3 <br><br>

    <strong>Do you need more help? Maybe something is not working?</strong> Visit us at Clearcode stand on the conference and we will help you any way we can ;)

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    In the argument a program gets a test string. The code has to print:
    {{ terminal(codes.example1) }}
    The task comes with a twist though: <strong>no digits are allowed in the code</strong>
    so you have to print 2019 (or access first argv argument) some other way ;)
</p>
<h2>Other rules</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Result must be printed in <strong>STDOUT</strong></li>
    <li>Program gets from 1 argument (argv)</li>
    <li><strong>Each</strong> line must have newline char (\n) at the end</li>
    <li>The lines must not have any characters after newline char (\n)</li>
    <li>If there are multiple first places (same amount of chars) the posting date will decide</li>
</ol>
<h2>examples</h2>
<p>
    {{ terminal(codes.example2) }}
</p>
<p>
    {{ terminal(codes.example3) }}
</p>
<h2>Happy coding!</h2>
